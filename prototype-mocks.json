			"description": "The awakening of one's Kundalini is a byproduct of spiritual growth and takes place at higher spiritual levels. The Kundalini is spiritual energy, which lies dormant, coiled at the base of spine for an average person. Through spiritual practice when one achieves the spiritual level of 60% it begins to rise from the base of the spine through the Central channel (Sushumnanadi) right till the top of the head. While it does so, the Kundalini awakens each of 7 chakras along the way. Whatever the spiritual path, when there is spiritual growth the Kundalini rises.",
